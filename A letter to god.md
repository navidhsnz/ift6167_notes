A Long letter to God!

After the Halabja Genocide,
I wrote a complaint to God. I went Outside
And I read it to a tree. 
The tree cried.

"Your plan is flawed,
I can't be your carrier to God,"
Said a bird nearby
"For I need a wing far more broad."

Late that night, under the stars so high
the mourning angle of this poem came by.
"Fret not." Said the angel.
I will take it to the galaxies in the sky."

"But I cannot give you guarantee
 that he will take the letter from me. 
"Thank you,", I said, "You shall fly"
The angel flew and took the plea.

The following day, the reply came.
Someone had written, Ubaid was his name
From God's office, Fourth-rank secretary. 
On the same letter, bottom of the frame

"Write in Arabic, you brain dead!
"No one here knows Kurdish, and we can't take it to god" it read
