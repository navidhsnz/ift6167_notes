#### Predicting Networkâ€™s Behaviour at Scale:
- Closed-box prediction: empirical scaling laws
- Open-box predictions: observing learning dynamics

#paper: Classical but important paper starting this field: [[gpt3 paper.pdf]]

Transition from memorization to generalization:
#paper: [[predicting grokking long before it happens.pdf]]

Grokking: **a phenomenon when a neural network suddenly learns a pattern in the dataset and jumps from random chance generalization to perfect generalization very suddenly**

Trends started with language. 
Next modality was Vision and later video.
Other modalities are catching up!
